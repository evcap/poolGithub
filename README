Welcome to Sean's Pool Tournament! 

The tournament is up and running on Ropsten at 0x2a37F0fE87681282E4305AAd4663245F8be77dae.

The source code is available in this repo and is verified on Etherscan. 

The current version requires 0.001 ETH to register, and pays out the full 0.004 ETH to the winner. 4 participants are required for the runTournament function to be called, which must be done manually.

The contract has many security flaws and is not to be used for anything serious, it is just practice.

TODO: 

- Change the set randNonce function to a constructor, instead of requiring someone to set it. Then remove ability to change it.
- Add ERC-20 functionality: minting for select addresses; use for tournament entry and payout instead of ETH
- Add tracking for highest rolls and consecutive, total wins: To be used for:
- Add NFT store: NFTs like "Pool Champion" requires 50 wins. "Cool Kid" requires having rolled a 100 stylepoint game. etc.
